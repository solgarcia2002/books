#BOOK me
=====================================

This is an example project implements NestJs and MySqL for Backend, and NextJS for FrontEnd.

I recorded a [Video](https://www.loom.com/share/df48a3eb122242bd85446da58a23db64) of my local env in order to show it working on the entire workflow.

In order to execute this you will find attached both projects as subrepos of this main repo.
